# weather-checker

This app was created by me 
i have use open weather api along with html , css & Js to achive this simple project 
The api key present there will be offline soon , i wanted to deploy it on github pages therefore i left the api key as it is 
you just have to enter name of city to check basic weather info , for additional about weather info open the developer console , there will be a js object you can have allweather info in that object , basically that object returned by an api call to open weather 
thank you....
